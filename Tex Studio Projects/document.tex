\section{Machine Learning}
	\subsection{Definitions:}
		\paragraph{Definition 1:}
		Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being programmed explicitly. The primary aim of machine learning is to allow computers to improve their performance on a specific task, such as recognizing images or speech, by analyzing large amounts of data and detecting patterns and trends. This involves the development of algorithms that can learn from the data, make predictions, or decisions based on that data, and create systems that can adapt and enhance their performance over time. The ultimate goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn and make decisions in a way that simulates human intelligence. \cite{alpaydin2010introduction}.
		\paragraph{Definition 2:}
		Machine learning is a scientific field within artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to act without being programmed explicitly. Its main objective is to teach machines to learn from data and use that knowledge to make decisions or predictions. Machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to automatically identify patterns and trends in data and use them to make predictions or decisions about new data. This technique has been successfully implemented in numerous domains, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, predictive analytic, and self-driving cars, among others. \cite{murphy2012machine}.
		
	\subsection{Features of machine Learning}	
		\paragraph{Automation:}
		Machine learning automates the process of building analytical models. Once trained, a model can be used to make predictions or decisions without human intervention. This means that the system can learn patterns and relationships from data and make decisions based on that learning. The automated nature of machine learning makes it an efficient tool for tasks that require repetitive pattern recognition or analysis. Machine learning models can also be used to automatically detect and diagnose faults in complex systems, such as industrial equipment, by analyzing sensor data. \cite{alpaydin2010introduction}
	
		\paragraph{Adaptivity:}
		Machine learning models can adapt to changing data and learn from new examples. This means that they can improve their accuracy over time and become more effective. As new data becomes available, the model can be updated and retrained to improve its predictions. This adaptability is a key feature of machine learning, as it allows the system to continually learn and evolve to better meet the needs of its users. Machine learning models that can adapt to new data can be used in a wide range of applications, including fraud detection, speech recognition, and autonomous vehicles.  \cite{hastie2009elements}
	
		\paragraph{Generalization:}
		: Generalization is a key aspect of machine learning, which enables models to make predictions on new and unseen data by learning from the training data. The ability to generalize allows machine learning models to identify and apply patterns and relationships in the training data to new, unseen data. This is crucial because models may need to be applied to real-world situations where the training data is unavailable. For example, a machine learning model trained on historical sales data can be used to make predictions about future sales, even if the specific sales data is unknown. The ability to generalize is an important feature of machine learning as it allows models to be utilized in various applications, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in making predictions and decisions. \cite{bishop2006pattern}
	
		\paragraph{Interactivity: }
		One of the key advantages of machine learning algorithms is their ability to interact with their environment and adapt their behavior in response to feedback. This means that machine learning systems can learn from their users and improve their performance over time. Interactive machine learning systems have a broad range of applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, and recommendation engines. These systems can learn from user feedback and adjust their recommendations or responses to better satisfy the user's needs. This feature of machine learning is highly beneficial, as it enables the development of intelligent systems that can provide more personalized and accurate recommendations, leading to enhanced user satisfaction. \cite{amershi2014power}
	
		\paragraph{Scalability: }
		Machine learning algorithms are highly scalable, making them suitable for a wide range of applications that involve complex problems and large datasets. This scalability enables machine learning algorithms to be used in areas such as personalized recommendations, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. The ability to handle large datasets is critical to machine learning as it allows algorithms to learn and make more accurate predictions. The scalability of machine learning models makes them highly versatile and applicable in various fields, including image recognition and natural language processing, where large datasets are crucial for model training and improved performance. \cite{jordan2015machine}
		
		\paragraph{Nonlinearity: }
		Machine learning models are designed to capture complex and often nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, making them highly effective for tasks such as natural language processing and image recognition. Nonlinearity refers to relationships between input and output variables that are not simple or linear, and instead are complex and nonlinear. Machine learning models excel at capturing these complex relationships, which can be used to make highly accurate predictions. For instance, a machine learning model used for image recognition can identify intricate features in an image, such as edges, textures, and colors, to classify it accurately. This feature of machine learning is critical for complex and challenging tasks that require advanced pattern recognition and analysis. \cite{lecun2015deep}

\section{Model Learning Methods and CNN}
		\subsection{CNN Definition :}
		A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model that has proven to be particularly effective in image classification tasks. It works by applying a series of convolutional filters to the input image, which helps to identify and extract meaningful features from the image. These features are then processed through a series of layers, allowing the network to learn increasingly complex representations of the image. The end result is a set of predicted classes or labels that describe the content of the input image. \cite{lecun2015deep}

		\subsection{how CNN Works:}
		Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model used in computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. These models automatically extract important features from input images by applying convolutional filters.
		
		When processing an input image, a CNN uses these filters to detect patterns by sliding over the image and computing dot products between the filter weights and image pixels within the filter's receptive field. Afterward, the resulting feature maps are passed through activation and pooling layers to reduce their spatial resolution and into fully connected layers to classify the image.
		
		During the training process, CNN weights are updated using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. This allows the model to learn increasingly complex representations of the input image, enabling it to accurately recognize patterns and objects within images. Due to their impressive performance in various computer vision tasks, CNNs are commonly used in the field.

		\subsection{Learning Methods: }
			\paragraph{Supervised Learning}
			Supervised learning is a machine learning technique where the model is trained on labeled data, enabling it to learn to map input data to output data. This technique is commonly used in tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. In supervised learning, the labeled data is used to train the model, and the trained model can then make predictions on new, unlabeled data. \cite{alpaydin2010introduction}
		
			\paragraph{Unsupervised Learning}
			Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique where the model is trained on unlabeled data to find patterns or structure in the data. This technique is commonly used in clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, where the model groups similar data points together based on their similarities or differences. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not rely on specific output data to guide the learning process. \cite{goodfellow2016deep}

			\paragraph{Reinforcement Learning}
			Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique where an agent learns by exploring its environment and receiving feedback. The goal of the agent is to maximize a cumulative reward signal by making decisions that lead to positive outcomes. This approach is commonly used in robotics and game playing, where the agent needs to learn through trial and error. \cite{sutton2018reinforcement}

			\paragraph{semi-supervised Learning}
			This approach lies between supervised and unsupervised learning, and combines the benefits of both, the model can learn more efficiently and effectively 
			\paragraph{active learning}
			In active learning, the machine learning algorithm selects and queries the user for the most useful data points to label, rather than labeling all data points upfront. This method allows the algorithm to iteratively improve its model's performance, ultimately reducing the amount of labeled data required for training. Active learning is a useful technique in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, allowing for more efficient and effective use of resources. \cite{settles2009active}

			\paragraph{transfer learning.}
			Transfer learning is a method of reusing a pre-trained machine learning model's knowledge to solve a different but related problem. The technique involves fine-tuning the pre-trained model using a smaller dataset for the new task. By leveraging the learned features from the original task, the model can achieve better accuracy on the new task than it would without transfer learning.
